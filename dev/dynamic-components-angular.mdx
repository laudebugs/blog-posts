Angular components can be created (instantiated) at build-time or at run-time. Creating components at run-time (dynamically) is what we are going to look at.

Broadly speaking, there are two ways to create dynamic components in Angular:

1. Using a `ViewContainerRef` - that [‚Äúrepresents a container where one or more views can be attached to a component.‚Äù](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewContainerRef#viewcontainerref) or
2. By using Angular‚Äôs built in [`NgComponentOutlet` directive](https://angular.io/api/common/NgComponentOutlet)

# Using `ViewContainerRef`

The `ViewContainerRef` is a class that gets access to a container where other components (host views) using the `createComponent()` method.

To dynamically create a component, we have to decide how and where we would like to place the component (the ‚Äúanchor point‚Äù).

## Defining the anchor point

How you define the anchor point determines where you can place it within a host component.

### The Anchor Directive

Following the [Angular docs example](https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader#the-anchor-directive) on creating a dynamic component, one can utilize a directive placed on an element such that the element will act as an insertion point to the dynamic component (a host - i.e. ‚ÄúCreate the dynamic component and place me wherever you see this directive‚Äù on an element.)

To achieve this, we first create the directive and inject the `ViewContainerRef` . The `ViewContainerRef` will get a reference to the element on which the directive is placed, dynamically create the component and insert it into the view at the position where the element is.

Take the scenario where we would like to create a list of user profiles with images for which we would want to display (a simple example that can be achieved with other ways but easy enough to demonstrate with dynamic components)

```ts
import { Directive, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[userProfileHost]',
})
export class UserProfileDirective{
  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }
}
```

When we then create our host component template, we can place this directive on an element such as a `div` or using angular‚Äôs `ng-template` or `ng-container`.

```html
<!-- using an html element -->
<div userProfileHost></div>

<!-- Using ng-template -->
<ng-template userProfileHost></ng-template>

<!-- using ng-container -->
<ng-container userProfileHost></ng-container>
```

**Q: Are all of these valid??**

We can then get a reference to the element with the directive by querying the component template for the first occurrence of the directive (using `ViewChild` ), or all occurrences of the directive (using `ViewChildren`):

```ts
/* Using ViewChild to get the first occurrence */
@ViewChild(UserProfileDirective, { static: true }) userProfileHost: UserProfileDirective;

/* Using ViewChildren to get the all occurrences */
@ViewChildren(UserProfileDirective, { static: true }) userProfileHosts: QueryList<UserProfileDirective>;
```

<Aside>

Note that `@ViewChildren` will return a `QueryList` - that contains a list of of `ViewContainerRef` types. To get elements inside of the `QueryList`, one can use the `QueryList`'s `.length` property together with the `.get` method to get an element at a particular index. For example, for a query list of length 1, we can get the first element by `userProfileHosts.get(0)`. In our example this will return a `ViewContainerRef` that contains a `UserProfileDirective` instance. Documentation on [`@ViewChildren` can be found here](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewChildren) .

</Aside>

### Using a Template Variable to target an element as an Anchor

One can target an element to act as a host for our dynamic component by using a template variable that follows the syntax `#` followed by whatever variable name we would like. For example, if our template variable name is to be called: `UserProfileEntry` then, in our html template, we would have:

```html
<!-- using an html element -->
<div #UserProfileEntry></div>

<!-- Using ng-template -->
<ng-template #UserProfileEntry></ng-template>

<!-- using ng-container -->
<ng-container #UserProfileEntry></ng-container>
```

### The Host View as the Anchor

We can use the host view (the component in which we will create the dynamic component) as an anchor for the newly created component. In this case, the created components would be appended at the end of the DOM tree. This works if we know that we don‚Äôt have to insert the newly created elements before other elements that were generated at build time.

In this case, we inject the `ViewContainerRef` into the component:

## Creating the Dynamic Component

Taking the `@ViewChild` use case, (the same applies to the `@ViewChildren` case), the view queries are set before the `ngAfterViewInit` life cycle hook is called. We can then create our dynamic components at this point.

```ts
import { Component, OnDestroy, AfterViewInit, ViewChild, } from '@angular/core';

/* Assume we created this UserProfile component somewhere else */
import { UserProfileComponent } from './user-profile/user-profile-component.ts';

/* Assume that we have a User Service that retrieves user profile data */
import { UserService } from './services/user-service/user.service.ts';
@Component({
	selector: 'app-component',
	template: `
				<ng-template userProfileHost></ng-template>
				`,
})
export clase AppComponent extends OnInit, AfterViewInit {
	@ViewChild(UserProfileDirective, { static: true }) userProfileHost: UserProfileDirective;
	userProfile!: {username: string, picture: string}

	constructor(public userService: UserService){}

	ngOnInit(){
		this.userProfile = this.userService.profile
	}

	/* Create dynamic components here */
	ngAfterViewInit(){
		const viewContainerRef = this.userProfileHost.viewContainerRef

		// Create the component
		const userProfileComponent = viewContainerRef.createComponent<UserProfileComponent>(UserProfileComponent)
		// Pass data to the dynamically created component here.
		userProfileComponent.instance.profile = this.userProfile
	}
}
```

Similar example while using a template reference as an anchor:

```ts
// ... code ommited
@Component({
	selector: 'app-component',
	template: `
				<ng-container #UserProfileEntry></ng-container>
				`,
})
export clase AppComponent extends OnInit, AfterViewInit {
	@ViewChild('UserProfileEntry', { read: ViewContainerRef}) userProfileEntry: ViewContainerRef
	// ... code ommited
	ngAfterViewInit(){
		const userProfileComponent = this.userProfileEntry.createComponent<UserProfileComponent>(UserProfileComponent)
	    userProfileComponent.instance.user = this.userProfile;
	}
}
```

Similar example using the host element as the anchor:

```ts
// ... code ommited
@Component({
	selector: 'app-component',
	template: `<h1> Host element </h1>`,
})
export clase AppComponent extends OnInit, AfterViewInit {

	// ... code ommited

	/* Inject the ViewContainerRef into the component */
	constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef){}
	ngAfterViewInit(){
		/* Create the component */
		const userProfileComponent = this.viewContainerRef.createComponent<UserProfileComponent>(UserProfileComponent)
		/* Pass data to the dynamically created component here. */
		userProfileComponent.instance.profile = this.userProfile
	}
}
```

<Aside>

Notice that we are directly modifying the data of the dynamically created component.üò±
This works, but it becomes problematic when you want to be strict about immutability or uni-directional data flow, and with `QueryLists`, we can‚Äôt use this approach since the elements in the `QueryList` are immutable.

</Aside>

We also see another issue with this approach. Since we mutate the data of the dynamic component, Angular‚Äôs change detection will throw the `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` warning that you may have encountered before:

<img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/_/expression-changed-after-checked.png"/>

The reason for this particular case is that angular has detected that we have changed the variable after it was last checked when the dynamically created component‚Äôs view was initialized.

Some ways to resolve this is to move our code into the `ngAfterContentInit` life cycle hook or injecting the change detector (`ChangeDetectorRef`) and calling its `detectChanges()` method:

```ts
// code ommitted
export class AppComponent implements AfterViewInit{

	/* Inject the ChangeDetectorRef */
	constructor(cd: ChangeDetectorRef){}

	ngAfterViewInit(){
		/* Create the component */
		const userProfileComponent = this.viewContainerRef.createComponent<UserProfileComponent>(UserProfileComponent)
		/* Pass data to the dynamically created component here. */
		userProfileComponent.instance.profile = this.userProfile
		/*  Tell angular to check for changes */
		this.cd.detectChanges()
	}
}
```

The `ViewContainerRef` also provides a way to inject dependencies into our dynamically created component in the options object ([the optional second parameter of the `createComponent` method](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewContainerRef#createcomponent)). The options object contains the following extra parameters (quoted from the Angular docs):

- `index` - the index at which to insert the new components host view
- `injector` - the injector to use as the parent for the new component
- `ngModuleRef` - an ngModuleRef of the component‚Äôs `NgModule`
- `projectableNodes` - list of Dom nodes that should be projected though `ng-content`

Things begin to get a little more interesting as we explore this options object and how it expands our flexibility with dynamically created components. We‚Äôll explore the first two for now (`index` and `injector`.

### `index`

The `index` parameter allows us to insert a dynamically created component at a particular index. Say we would like to create a second component dynamically and place it at index `0`, then we would do something like:

```ts
const userProfileComponent2 = viewContainerRef.createComponent<UserProfileComponent>(UserProfileComponent, {index: 0})
```

Of course, we can‚Äôt place an element at index `1` if the length of dynamically created components in the `ViewContainerRef` is `0`.

### `injector`

We can inject dependencies into our dynamic components using the `injector` parameter.

Say, for instance, we want to pass in the user data when we create the component. We can first create an injector token that we can user for that dependency:

```ts
import { InjectionToken } from "@angular/core";

export const USER_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<string>('user')
```

In our `user-profile.component.ts` file, we can then pass this dependency as a required dependency, or mark it as an optional dependency in the constructor - if you want to:

```ts
// In user-profile.component.ts
constructor(@Inject(USER_TOKEN) public user: IUser) {}

// As an optional dependency
constructor(@Inject(USER_TOKEN) @Optional() public user: IUser) {}
```

<Aside>

It‚Äôs interesting to point out that marking the dependency as optional (using the `@Optional()` decorator) means that we can leave it out when creating the dynamic component. Otherwise, we would run into a null injector error when we call `createComponent` (`R3InjectorError`):

<img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/_/null-injector-token.png"/>


</Aside>

## Recap

However you decide to choose where to anchor your components, all these ways are valid and can go far in and of themselves. One advantage of dynamically generating the component using the `ViewContainerRef` is that you have access to the current state of the newly created component and can leverage it for your particular use case.
