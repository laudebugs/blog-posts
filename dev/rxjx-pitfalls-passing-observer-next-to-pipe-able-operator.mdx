summary: 'When using RxJs operators, you can pass in a callback function as the next function of an Observer. A common pitfall is to pass in the next function of an Observer as a callback to an RxJs operator. This post explains why this may be a bad idea causing errors that may be hard to debug and how to avoid it.'

Passing `Subject.next` as the `next` parameter where an `Observer` is required.
Suppose you have an RxJs subject that is keeping track of the value in an observable stream (say called `stream$`).

```tsx
import { Subject, timer, take, tap } from 'rxjs'

const stream$ = timer(0, 1000).pipe(take(5))
```

One way to pass the current value to the subject is using the `tap` operator that accepts an observer, i.e. an object containing the `next`, `error` and `complete` functions.

If we only pass a callback function that logs out the current value in the observable stream, we would have something that looks like:

```tsx
stream$.pipe(tap(console.log)).subscribe()
/*
// Result would look like:
0
1
2
3
4
*/
```

If we have a subject called `_count` where we would like to keep track of the current value in the stream, the first instinct would be to replace `console.log` with `_count.next`:

```tsx
const _count = new Subject<number>()

stream$.pipe(tap<number>(_count.next)).subscribe()
```

However, you'll notice that the above implementation **\*\***\*\***\*\***does not work**\*\***\*\***\*\***, resulting in the error: `TypeError: _this._throwIfClosed is not a function`.

The reason being that RxJs's `Subject` is a class whose `next` implementation relies on `this` keyword which refers to the `_count` instance. You can [view the source code here](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/8.x/src/internal/Subject.ts#L60). Passing just the `_count.next` function would reference `this` which refers to the global scope and not the `_count` instance.

We can see this in action by implementing our own observer that references `this`:

```tsx
const observerStore = {
    store: new Array<number>(),
    next(value: number) {
        this.store.push(value)
    },
}
/* Replacing the _count with our observer would then look like belowüëáüèª */
stream$.pipe(tap<number>(observerStore.next)).subscribe()
```

The implementation above would also give us an error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')`. For the same reason that the `this` reference would refer to the `global` object and not the `observerStore` object.

<Aside>
üí° It's worth noting that if the observer's `next` implementation does not reference the `this` keyword, then passing in the `.next` function would work as expected.

</Aside>

For instance, if our `observerStore`'s `next` function just logged out the value, then passing in the `observerStore.next` to `tap` would work as expected since the `next` function does not reference `this`:

```tsx
const observerStore = {
    store: new Array<number>(),
    next(value: number) {
        console.log(value)
    },
}

/* Works */
stream$.pipe(tap<number>(_count.next)).subscribe()
```

### Solutions

1. Pass in the observer object

    The straightforward solution would be to simply to pass in the observer object into the `tap` operator:

    ```tsx
    /* This works */
    stream$.pipe(tap<number>(observerStore)).subscribe()
    ```

2. Bind the observer to `this`

    One could `[Function.prototype.bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)` which is available to the function prototype to bind `this` to the observer object so that when `this` is referenced, the function references the observer instead of the global `this` object:

    ```tsx
    /* _count Subjct */
    stream$.pipe(tap<number>(_count.next.bind(_count))).subscribe()

    /* the observerStore */
    stream$.pipe(tap<number>(observerStore.next.bind(observerStore))).subscribe()
    ```

    [As the MDN docs state](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind), ‚ÄúThe¬†**`bind()`** method creates a new function that, when called, has its¬†`this`keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.‚Äù

Although both of the solutions work, passing the observer object is much more clear to another reader of the code on what is going on whereas the latter would cause someone who didn't write the code to stop and ask why we are calling `.bind` in the first place.

Happy hacking!
