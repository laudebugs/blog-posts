Now, we are moving to the part where the character knows well and true that what he should do and that what he wants to do.

To attempt to do what one wants to do is more of an act of faith. Doing what one ought to do is the boring choice - the expected route. And do you want to get a pat on the back or do you want to taste some blood. All this will coalesce into your dreams becoming realities that quickly fade and you sink further into the abyss. Or inch slowly towards glory. Your glory — in your terms — your fate — an eternal one. Perhaps you were meant to choose your fate and your fate chose you.

Anyway, I'm just thinking whether I should just finish this bottle of wine or buy more next time.
