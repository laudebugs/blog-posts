There's no replacement for the feeling of the warmth of the cold sand, against the warm ocean water. When was the last time I went to the beach, and tucked myself in a heap of sand - and forgotten all the todos? It's been a while since I stared away into the nothingness. This whole year has been about hitting targets, moving forward, playing nice and running so much I sometimes forget I can walk. I find those small moments of rest helpful - the weekends, the evenings and nights ~ but there's this constant ring in my ear - that keeps me half asleep. I've slept little over the past weeks. Perhaps the holidays really are welcome and I need to plan a trip to the beach and maybe to the tropics.
