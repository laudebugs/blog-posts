Thinking about how much time I spend awake - trying to keep up, trying to inch ahead. How I keep on forgetting to do things - or rather, place them at the back of my mind. The important things. Who determines what's important? I think sometimes there's a lot to take from the past selves - the memories of fathers and mothers passed down to us - that could apply so particularly to the now - but there's an arrogance with wanting to walk the road ahead by my own efforts. Such is the wanting to always work, always please, always learn, always serve the self.
