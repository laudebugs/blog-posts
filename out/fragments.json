When was the last time I went to the beach, and tucked myself in a heap of sand - and forgotten all the todos? It&#39;s been a while since I stared away into the nothingness. This whole year has been about hitting targets, moving forward, playing nice and running so much I sometimes forget I can walk. I find those small moments of rest helpful - the weekends, the evenings and nights ~ but there&#39;s this constant ring in my ear - that keeps me half asleep. I&#39;ve slept little over the past weeks. Perhaps the holidays really are welcome and I need to plan a trip to the beach and maybe to the tropics.</p>\n ]]>\n                </content:encoded>\n                <media:content height=\"720\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/orange-clouds.jpeg\" width=\"1280\"/>\n                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/orange-clouds.jpeg\"/>\n                    <media:credit>\n                                <![CDATA[ Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tobiastu?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Tobias Tullius</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/tropic?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a> ]]>\n                                </media:credit>\n                    \n\n            </item>\n            \n            <item>\n                <title>Memories and Fears</title>\n                <link>https://www.laudebugs.me/fragments#memories-and-fears</link>\n                <pubDate>2021-12-05T00:00:00.000Z</pubDate>\n                <author>Laurence B.

How I keep on forgetting to do things - or rather, place them at the back of my mind. The important things. Who determines what&#39;s important? I think sometimes there&#39;s a lot to take from the past selves - the memories of fathers and mothers passed down to us - that could apply so particularly to the now - but there&#39;s an arrogance with wanting to walk the road ahead by my own efforts. Such is the wanting to always work, always please, always learn, always serve the self.</p>\n ]]>\n                </content:encoded>\n                <media:content height=\"720\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/memories-and-fears.jpeg\" width=\"1280\"/>\n                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/memories-and-fears.jpeg\"/>\n                    \n                    \n\n            </item>\n            \n        </channel>\n        </rss>",
