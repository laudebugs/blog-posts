I wonder – in my alone time, how I can be so whole yet so needing of the networks and relationships that surround me. Perhaps it was living in a noisy house with plenty of siblings, or always having some presence around me throughout boarding school. Yet, I cannot shake the feeling that when lines too straight they go straight to the blinding sun. In other words – we, I meander, my callouses grow, slip on the stairs occasionally, what used to taste horrid now has a comfort to it. We learn to love what we disliked with such venom and continue to reinvent ourselves.</p>\n ]]>\n                </content:encoded>\n                <media:content height=\"720\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/folding-skin.jpeg\" width=\"1280\"/>\n                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/folding-skin.jpeg\"/>\n                    <media:credit>\n                                <![CDATA[ Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@ilferrets?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Alessio Ferretti</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/evolution?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a> ]]>\n                                </media:credit>\n                    \n\n            </item>\n            \n            <item>\n                <title>In the Middle of the Moving Field</title>\n                <link>https://www.laudebugs.me/fragments/middle-of-the-moving-field</link>\n                <pubDate>2021-12-21T00:00:00.000Z</pubDate>\n                <author>Laurence B.

Doing what one ought to do is the boring choice - the expected route. And do you want to get a pat on the back or do you want to taste some blood. All this will coalesce into your dreams becoming realities that quickly fade and you sink further into the abyss. Or inch slowly towards glory. Your glory — in your terms — your fate — an eternal one. Perhaps you were meant to choose your fate and your fate chose you. </p>\n<p>Anyway, I’m just thinking whether I should just finish this bottle of wine or buy more next time.</p>\n ]]>\n                </content:encoded>\n                <media:content height=\"720\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/middle-of-the-moving-field.jpeg\" width=\"1280\"/>\n                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/middle-of-the-moving-field.jpeg\"/>\n                    <media:credit>\n                                <![CDATA[ Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tomonogi?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Karori Production</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/sensation?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a> ]]>\n                                </media:credit>\n                    \n\n            </item>\n            \n            <item>\n                <title>Misery Business</title>\n                <link>https://www.laudebugs.me/fragments/misery-business</link>\n                <pubDate>2021-12-15T00:00:00.000Z</pubDate>\n                <author>Laurence B.

I skimpered a couple of steps, slowed pace and felt the winter wind piercing into my eyes numbing my cheeks and drying my lips. I felt thirsty, blood circling down to my nearly-sprained ankle. Pacing the trail, dew settled calm on top the stream to my right. Ducks, in uniform danced atop the crystal water surface. Dry hybernating trees stared into the air - frozen till Spring. How long to go? I change tracks, watch the couple gallop by. I nurse my foot with small step, then into a half-paced stride - trying to recoup my rhythm for the rest of the way. Still more to go.</p>\n ]]>\n                </content:encoded>\n                <media:content height=\"720\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/misery-business.jpeg\" width=\"1280\"/>\n                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/misery-business.jpeg\"/>\n                    <media:credit>\n                                <![CDATA[ Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kaups?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Kaupo Kalda</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/peaceful?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a> ]]>\n                                </media:credit>\n                    \n\n            </item>\n            \n            <item>\n                <title>Orange Clouds</title>\n                <link>https://www.laudebugs.me/fragments/orange-clouds</link>\n                <pubDate>2021-12-07T00:00:00.000Z</pubDate>\n                <author>Laurence B.

When was the last time I went to the beach, and tucked myself in a heap of sand - and forgotten all the todos? It&#39;s been a while since I stared away into the nothingness. This whole year has been about hitting targets, moving forward, playing nice and running so much I sometimes forget I can walk. I find those small moments of rest helpful - the weekends, the evenings and nights ~ but there&#39;s this constant ring in my ear - that keeps me half asleep. I&#39;ve slept little over the past weeks. Perhaps the holidays really are welcome and I need to plan a trip to the beach and maybe to the tropics.</p>\n ]]>\n                </content:encoded>\n                <media:content height=\"720\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/orange-clouds.jpeg\" width=\"1280\"/>\n                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/orange-clouds.jpeg\"/>\n                    <media:credit>\n                                <![CDATA[ Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tobiastu?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Tobias Tullius</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/tropic?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a> ]]>\n                                </media:credit>\n                    \n\n            </item>\n            \n            <item>\n                <title>Memories and Fears</title>\n                <link>https://www.laudebugs.me/fragments/memories-and-fears</link>\n                <pubDate>2021-12-05T00:00:00.000Z</pubDate>\n                <author>Laurence B.

How I keep on forgetting to do things - or rather, place them at the back of my mind. The important things. Who determines what&#39;s important? I think sometimes there&#39;s a lot to take from the past selves - the memories of fathers and mothers passed down to us - that could apply so particularly to the now - but there&#39;s an arrogance with wanting to walk the road ahead by my own efforts. Such is the wanting to always work, always please, always learn, always serve the self.</p>\n ]]>\n                </content:encoded>\n                <media:content height=\"720\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/memories-and-fears.jpeg\" width=\"1280\"/>\n                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbugasu/blog-posts/main/assets/memories-and-fears.jpeg\"/>\n                    \n                    \n\n            </item>\n            \n        </channel>\n        </rss>",
